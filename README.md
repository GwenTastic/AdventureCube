# AdventureCube v0.0.1

AdventureCube is a Fork based on [SugarCube](http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/) which is a free (gratis and libre) StoryFormat for [Twine/Twee](http://twinery.org/).

All Sugarcube Downloads and documentation as of currently are valid and can be found at [SugarCube website](http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/).

AdventureCube specific documentation will follow as development goes on.

This Fork is currently very early in Progress, and as of now is barely any different from SugarCube.


## BUILDING FROM SOURCE

If you want to build AdventureCube from scratch, then it simply follows the same instructions that [SugarCube's Buildprocess](https://github.com/tmedwards/sugarcube-2#building-from-source "Sugarcube's Buildprocess") provides.
